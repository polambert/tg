# tg
tg is a python utility for setting up small graphical interfaces in the terminal.

It is not as complex as curses, and should primarily be used for game development, graphing, or smaller programs.

## Todo
- Filling in shapes.
- Color Systems for gradients and transitions
- Keyboard Input Checking

## Possible Additions
- I might use curses as a part of the library. This would obviously not change the use of the library, but writing to a buffer instead of ANSI codes would be much faster for the end user.
